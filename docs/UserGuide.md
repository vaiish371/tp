ModMan, short for Module Manager, is a desktop app designed to help Teaching Assistants (TAs) manage their module(s).
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). ModMan helps to track module details as well as studentsâ€™ progress and data, all in one platform. It can also perform autograding for MCQ assignments.

### What is a CLI?
A command line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface used to view and manage computer files.

These include operating system CLIs like the Command Prompt on Windows, which can be used to run and interact with the ModMan application.

## How to use the User Guide
